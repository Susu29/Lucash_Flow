# Lucash_Flow : An accounting project

## Introduction : 
Hello, my name is Lucas. Today is the Sat 29 November and i'm starting this project in Arequipa, Peru.

Why ?

Well, first I need to make a final project for CS50.

But I wanna make a big project. A project i can build over time with small parts. A project That can be modular and cover diver areas of CS, especially data.

As an ex accountant, i guess it makes sense to try to implement a small software program. That could mix my old and new knowledge.

I had this idea the 22/02/2025, in the down of Da Lat, Vietnam.

 But instead I made a Python/PowerBI analytic project for Spotify listenning History 

Funnily enough, i've found two days ago my internship report from when i made my internship in a software developping agency. It was 3 days and i was 13 at this time.

Here is was it says :

"_Lors du premier jour de mon stage j'ai d'abord observer les développeurs faire leurs travail, puis, pendant les deux dernier jours de stage ,les développeurs nous ont appris les base du langage de programmation HTML, j'ai donc commencer a créer, avec l'aide des développeurs et d'un autre stagiaire, un site HTML de comptabilité._"

I've completely forgot about it and still have no idea that i've done this. But i think it's a sign to finally make it true.

It's a big project. So i'm planning to build it step by step. 

## Module Roadmap

### 0) Choosing the tools and building the roadmap

### 1) Make a very basic accounting software/interface
This one will be the first achievement. And will be submitted to CS50 as my final project. It will hopefully end up on giving me the CS50x Certification

### 2) End up my Spotify Project & Pass PowerBI PL-300 cert
I will then take a short break to finish my Spotify Project that i made in early 2025 in Alesund & Oslo, Norway. 95% will be ending up the PowerBI dashboard as my virtual machine is now more powerfull.  

It was awfull to run PowerBI on my MacBook Air M1 with 8GB ram with VmFusion. It seems to run much better with Parallels

5% which should take an afternoon will just consist of automating the different parts of my program. As i usually had to run 2 or 3 scripts. Even if a lot if already automated, I wanna make it a one click program.

### 3) Export the data Into PowerBI. 

I wanna make a simple DashBoard with PowerBI. Doing more or less at the same time that the step before<br>
Then include the PowerBI dashboard to the main page !!

### 4) Focusing on data engineering 
Obviously import from CSV.

Have to think about it but probably an automatic import from a website using Data Engineering Tools.

Maybe adding a cloud dimension ?

### 5) Learn ML by applying it to my accounting software

I have only basic notions in ML right now. But i'm thinking of accounting class determined by the name of the product ?
